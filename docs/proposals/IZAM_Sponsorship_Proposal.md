---

### What We Are NOT Promising

**Not a Finished Product**  
This is a graduation project with MVP-level features, not enterprise software. We are building a research prototype with commercial potential.

**Not Zero-Touch Automation**  
Human review will still be required for sensitive content, legal compliance, and edge cases. AI assists human decision-making; it does not replace it.

**Not Replacing Human Creativity**  
AI generates drafts and suggestions; your team provides strategic direction, brand intuition, and final approval. The goal is augmentation, not replacement.

**Not Guaranteed Performance**  
First deployment will require iterative refinement based on real-world feedback. We commit to transparency about what works and what needs improvement.

**Not 99% Uptime**  
That is an aspirational target for mature production systems. Realistic expectation for an MVP is 95%+ availability with proper hosting and monitoring.

**We are building a research prototype with commercial potential, not a turnkey solution.**
